# Appium integration
## Local setup
1. Setup Android Studio, Emulator and JAVA from this guide - https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/uiauto2-driver/
2. Do not install appium or drivers from the guide, because they are locally handled in the project
    - All commands from the guide which start with appium should be prefixed with `npx` and executed from the project root ex. `npx appium driver doctor uiautomator2`. Because appium is locally installed and not added to the %PATH
    - When running tests you need to start appium in a separate terminal with `npx appium` executed from project root folder.    

# Test execution
## Test exec parameters
+ {profile} is the name of the json in the config dir
+ {env} is the folder name in the config dir
### When you test locally and in headed mode open hooks.js and uncomment the slowMo
    yarn test {profile} {env} - all tests
    yarn test {profile} {env} features/tests/<test> - specific test
    
### Example - will run all tests using the exampleProfile from the dev folder
    yarn test exampleProfile dev
